RECOMMENDATION

The project has a solid foundation for Authentication and Basic Book CRUD. The immediate priority should be:

1. Implementing the Shopping Cart and Checkout Flow to enable transactions.
2. Developing the Catalog Search and Filtering logic to allow product discovery.
3. Connecting the Orders backend to the frontend dashboard.
